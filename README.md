# ECE30862-Object-Oriented-Programming
A repository for course ECE30862: Object-Oriented Programming using C++ and Java(Fall2015). 

Catalog Description:
The C++ and Java programming languages are presented. The language constructs discussed include classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, class derivation, abstract classes, interfaces, static class members, object construction and destruction, namespaces, exception handling, function overloading and overriding, function name overload resolution, container classes, template classes, etc. 



Learning Objectives:
A student who successfully fulfills the course requirements will have demonstrated:

    an understanding of the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism. [k]
    an ability to overload operators in C++. [c,e,k]
    an understanding of the difference between function overloading and function overriding. [k]
    an ability to incorporate exception handling in object-oriented programs. [k]
    an ability to use template classes and the STL library in C++. [k]
    an ability to write object-oriented programs of moderate complexity in C++. [e]
    an ability to write object-oriented programs of moderate complexity in Java. [e]
    an ability to write programs with multiple threads and use synchronization among threads. [k]
